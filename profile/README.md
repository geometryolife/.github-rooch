## 👋 Hi there! Welcome to RoochNetwork's developer community. We're so glad you stopped by!

Rooch is the first modular Layer 2 solution with the Move language, using Ethereum as its security layer. Our target is to provide a Move-based execution module to all Web3 application scenarios as well as be a bridge between all Web3 developers and versatile crypto ecosystems.

At Rooch we are working on bringing the best of Move to all Web3 developers. Devs can either directly build on our Rooch Layer 2 deployment on Ethereum or use Rooch as SDK to customize their own stacks for different application scenarios.

🚀 We're a team of passionate developers who love to build awesome things with code. Our focus is on creating high-quality, scalable Web3 infrastructure that solves real-world problems by the blockchain technology.

🤝 We're also big believers in collaboration and community. We love working with other developers and sharing our knowledge and experience. If you're interested in contributing to any of our projects, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
